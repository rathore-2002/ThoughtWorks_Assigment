# Choosing Between Inheritance and Composition

When designing software, particularly in object-oriented programming, deciding between inheritance and composition is crucial. Each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. This guide provides a brief overview to help you choose the best approach for your design goals.

## Inheritance

### Advantages
- **Code Reuse:** Promotes reuse through inheritance hierarchies.
- **Polymorphism:** Allows different classes to be used interchangeably if they inherit from a common base class.
- **Natural Modeling:** Suitable for "is-a" relationships (e.g., a Dog "is-a" Animal).

### Disadvantages
- **Tight Coupling:** Can lead to tight coupling between classes, making maintenance and extension harder.
- **Inflexibility:** Less flexible if you need to change or extend behavior dynamically at runtime.
- **Complexity:** Hierarchies can become complex and difficult to manage.

## Composition

### Advantages
- **Flexibility:** Allows objects to be composed of other objects, promoting flexibility.
- **Code Reuse:** Favors object composition over class inheritance for better code reuse.
- **Behavior Modification:** Easier to modify behavior by changing the composition of objects at runtime.

### Disadvantages
- **Boilerplate Code:** May result in more boilerplate code to delegate method calls to composed objects.
- **Modeling Relationships:** Can be less intuitive for modeling "is-a" relationships (though interfaces can help).
